This is a spriting tool originally meant for Space Station 13.
To run it, use the batch file. It should refresh all sprite sheets.

The order for the sprites is Concave, Convex, Horizontal, Vertical and finally, Flat.
They're named based on the corner type. You can also change this order via the ".toml" files.
Also keep in mind when making a new ".toml" file that you have to make its name the same as the ".png" you're targeting.
Otherwise, shit will just not work.
